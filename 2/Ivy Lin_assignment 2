	<h2 id="purpose">What is the purpose of the website?</h2>
		<p> The purpose of the website is to allow collections of my work to be viewed at anywhere on smart device. This way your portfolio is always ready to show. The purpose of the website is also to nicely advertise me as a designer in a cohesive and sophisticated manner.

	<h2 id="tone">What tone do you want for the site’s written content?</h2>
		<p> The tone would be set in a casual yet professional way. I don’t want it to be formal because a resume is already doing that and I want a portfolio to show who I really am and to be more fun and more playful. </p>
	</section>
    
    <section>
	<h2 id="pcontent">What will be the primary content of your site?</h2>
		<p> Primary content of my site would be About, Architecture, and Communication Design, these two are areas where I spend most of my time building such portfolio and it’s the area I want to focus on so it would be most important for people that want to hire me to see that. 
 </p>
	</section>
    
    <section>
	<h2 id="scontent">What will be the secondary content?</h2>
		<p> The secondary content would be  Art and Jewelry, where these are not as important but it adds to the content and to show who I am and what I do in a complete realm after viewing the primary content.  
</p>
	</section>
    
    <section>
	<h2 id="navigation">How will users navigate through your site?</h2>
		<p> Users will navigate through my site through categories. First it would just be to enter the website, then it would be divided into categories of “About”, Communication Design, Architecture” “Art” and Jewelry”. Then after one is picked they continue through the same sort of organization. This makes it easy for users to navigate through the website, this allows them to focus on the context instead of how to use the site. </p>
