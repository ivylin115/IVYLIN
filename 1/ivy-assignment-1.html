		<h2>Website Comparison</h2>
		<h3 id="successful"> A Successful Website</h3>
		<p> It is essential for <a href="http://www.amazon.com"> Amazon </a> to be easy to use, to allows people from different regions to buy things online with a click of a button and to be delivered anywhere around the world. The key success of their company depends greatly on the usability of their website and they have succeeded that greatly! </p>

		<p>The website is very straightforward and easy to navigate; you can shop in a specific department, you can see what’s new or on sale, or you can simply search the item you want to buy in the search tab. On the homepage they even recommend you items according to what you have purchased or viewed. They also show interesting finds on the homepage that update daily. It includes all the feature that is needed and you can buy pretty much anything on here too with a lower price! </p>

		<p>They also have a video section that allows you to stream movies and tv shows. There is nothing you can’t do on this website. However, the reason why there are so many functions on this website is because of how many customers they have. These functions makes people want to join them but the reason Amazon has so many customers in the first place was because of how easy it is to use, how efficient it is, how easy it is to pick it up after a long period of time, and how little error there is on this website.</p>
		
		 <p> This website is clearly organized, and there are usually no errors in the process. This makes it tremendously fast to navigate and to purchase an item. Who wouldn't want to be part of a community where items sends to your house in just a few days with fast purchase online? Not only that, the design of the website isn’t bad, it certainly isn’t beautiful, but it is designed in a organized and clean manner that makes it pleasant for us to shop and for us to want to come back. I have been using amazon for the past 3 years, and I believe, they purposely keep the navigation very similar after updates. Big changes are never made to keep it easy for us to use and to not lose customers because of new advancement but instead to maintain the easiness of the web while making it even more usable and adding  different unique features.  </p>

		<h3 id="less-successful"> A less Successful Website</h3>
		
		<p> 
			<a href= "http://www.verizon.com"> Verizon </a> is a less successful website because of it’s efficiency and errors. They layout of the website is quite straight forward, it’s not particularly hard to navigate but it certainly goes into a lot of trouble and many time is spend trying to figure it out or to go back to find details. Logging into the account and managing the account is also very difficult. Therefore, many time is wasted on the website just to accomplish a simple task. My personal experience with Verizon is terrible, when I simply was trying to see the bill and pay the bill, it always takes hours to accomplish. It starts with logging into the account, as I enter my username and password and click enter, it always indicate that the password is incorrect. Eventually with a lot of failed attempts, I click on ‘forget my password’, but again, the temporary code sent to my email doesn’t work either. Only after a lot of attempts and many request with codes, does it work every once in a while. After you are finally logged in you change the password, however, again, it doesn’t work! It is the same thing that is happening, you have to request temporary codes that takes a lot attempts to finally let you log in. This is very irritating which makes the website user unfriendly. Although other functions of this website isn’t hard, some specific errors causes less efficiency that results in an unpleasant experience. Many clients will therefore leave and choose other methods or companies to work with.
